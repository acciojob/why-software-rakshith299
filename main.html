	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>There’s nothing more satisfying than solving a problem that’s been around for a while and nobody else knows how to solve. As a Software Developer you constantly provide solutions for users’ problems. You can be working on the occasional quick fix as well as more complex strategic solutions. Some problem-solving skills required to be a Software Developer include being able to split complex goals into smaller, more manageable ones. You should also be able to think in parallel. This means taking your smaller tasks, rearranging them and seeing if any are unnecessary so you can optimise your tasks and save time. </p>
